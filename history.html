            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            <p>
                The history of Spain dates back to ancient times, with the earliest human settlements appearing in the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 35,000 years ago. Spain was later colonized by various groups such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians before being conquered by the Romans.

            <h2>Roman and Visigothic Period</h2>
            <p>
                During the Roman Empire, Spain (known as Hispania) was an important province, contributing to the empire’s wealth and military strength. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Spain came under the rule of the Visigoths, a Germanic tribe that influenced the region’s culture and governance.

            <h2>Modern History</h2>
            <p>
                The Spanish Empire gradually declined in the 18th and 19th centuries, losing many of its colonies. The 20th century brought significant political upheaval, with the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) leading to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Following Franco's death in 1975, Spain transitioned to a democracy and became a member of the European Union in 1986.
